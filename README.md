# Memory Game 

Assignments 1 and 2 of the [Stanford CS193p iOS development course](https://cs193p.sites.stanford.edu/).

## Assignment 1

The goal of this assignment is to recreate the demonstration given in the first two lectures and then make some small enhancements. It is important that you understand what you are doing with each step of recreating the demo from lecture so that you are prepared to do those enhancements. 

### Required Tasks

- [x] Get the Memorize game working as demonstrated in lectures 1 and 2. Type in all the code. Do not copy/paste from anywhere. 

- [x] Currently the cards appear in a predictable order (the matches are always side-by-side, making the game very easy). Shuffle the cards.

  ```swift
  init(numberOfMemoryPairs: Int, cardContentFactory: (Int) -> CardContent) {
          cards = Array<Card>()
  
          for pairIndex in 0..<numberOfMemoryPairs {
              let content = cardContentFactory(pairIndex)
              cards.append(Card(id: pairIndex * 2, content: content))
              cards.append(Card(id: pairIndex * 2 + 1, content: content))
          }
          cards.shuffle()
      }
  ```

- [x] Our cards are currently arranged in a single row (we‚Äôll fix that next week). That‚Äôs making our cards really tall and skinny (especially in portrait) which doesn‚Äôt look very good. Force each card to have a width to height ratio of 2:3 (this will result in empty space above and/or below your cards, which is fine).

  ```swift
  .aspectRatio(2/3, contentMode: .fit)
  ```

- [x] Have your game start up with a random number of pairs of cards between 2 pairs and 5 pairs. 5. When your game randomly shows 5 pairs, the font we are using for the emoji will be too large (in portrait) and will start to get clipped. Have the font adjust in the 5 pair case (only) to use a smaller font than .largeTitle. Continue to use .largeTitle when there are 4 or fewer pairs in the game. 

  ‚Äã	--> additional memory game themes implemented, see assignment 2

- [x] Your UI should work in portrait or landscape on any iOS device. In landscape your cards will be larger (but still 2:3 aspect ratio). This probably will not require any work on your part (that‚Äôs part of the power of SwiftUI), but be sure to experiment with running on different simulators in Xcode to be sure.

## Assignment 2

The goal of this assignment is to continue to recreate the demonstrations given in the next two lectures (first four lectures in total) and then make some bigger enhancements. It is important that you understand what you are doing with each step of recreating the demo from lecture so that you are prepared to do those enhancements. 

### Required Tasks

- [x] Get the Memorize game working as demonstrated in lectures 1 through 4. Type in all the code. Do not copy/paste from anywhere. 

- [x] Your game should still shuffle the cards. 

- [x] Architect the concept of a ‚Äútheme‚Äù into your game. A theme consists of a name for the theme, a set of emoji to use, a number of cards to show (which, for at least one, but not all themes, should be random), and an appropriate color to use to draw (e.g. orange would be appropriate for a Halloween theme). 

  ```swift
  struct MemoryTheme {
      var name: String
      var color: ThemeColor
      var emojis: [String]
  
      static let halloween  = MemoryTheme(name: "Halloween", color: .orange, emojis: ["üëª", "üéÉ", "üï∑", "üßô", "üíÄ"].shuffled())
      static let christmas = MemoryTheme(name: "Christmas", color: .red, emojis: ["üéÑ", "ü§∂", "üéÖ", "üéÅ"].shuffled())
      static let winter = MemoryTheme(name: "Winter", color: .lightblue, emojis: ["ü•∂", "‚ùÑÔ∏è", "‚òÉÔ∏è", "üß¶", "üå®", "‚õ∏", "üèÇ"].shuffled())
      static let beach = MemoryTheme(name: "Beach", color: .yellow, emojis:  ["üëô", "üèù", "‚õ±", "ü©≥", "ü©±", "üóø"].shuffled())
      static let anmimals = MemoryTheme(name: "Animals", color: .green, emojis: ["üê∂", "üê±", "üê∑", "üêµ", "üêî", "ü¶á", "üêç", ""].shuffled())
      static let alcohol = MemoryTheme(name: "Alcohol!", color: .gray, emojis:  ["ü•É", "ü•Ç", "üç∑", "üç∫", "üç∂", "üç∏", "üçπ", "üçæ"].shuffled())
  
      static let themes = [halloween, christmas, winter, beach, anmimals, alcohol]
  
      enum ThemeColor {
          case orange
          case red
          case lightblue
          case yellow
          case green
          case gray
      }
  }
  ```

  

- [x] Support at least 6 different themes in your game. 

  --> see above

- [x] A new theme should be able to be added to your game with a single line of code.

  ```swift
  init() {
          self.theme = MemoryTheme.themes.randomElement()!
          self.model = EmojiMemoryGame.createMemoryGame(with: theme)
      }
  ```

- [x] Add a ‚ÄúNew Game‚Äù button to your UI which begins a brand new game. This new game should have a randomly chosen theme. You can put this button anywhere you think looks best in your UI. 

  ```swift
  Button("New Game") {
                      withAnimation(.easeInOut(duration: 0.5)){
                          viewModel.newGame()
                      }
  ```

- [x] Show the theme‚Äôs name somewhere in your UI. 8. Keep score in your game by giving 2 points for every match and penalizing 1 point for every previously seen card that is involved in a mismatch. 

  ```swift
  .navigationBarTitle(viewModel.theme.name, displayMode: .inline)
  ```

  ```swift
  mutating func choose(card: Card){
          if let chosenIndex = cards.firstIndex(matching: card), !cards[chosenIndex].isFaceUp, !cards[chosenIndex].isMatched{
              if let potentialMatchIndex = indexOfTheOneAndOnlyFaceUpCard{
                  if cards[chosenIndex].content == cards[potentialMatchIndex].content{
                      cards[chosenIndex].isMatched = true
                      cards[potentialMatchIndex].isMatched = true
                      score += 2 - numberOfMismatchedCards
                      numberOfMismatchedCards = 0
                  }else {
                      numberOfMismatchedCards += 2
                  }
                  cards[chosenIndex].isFaceUp = true
              }else{
                  indexOfTheOneAndOnlyFaceUpCard = chosenIndex
              }
          }
      }
  ```

- [x] Display the score in your UI in whatever way you think looks best. 

  ```swift
  .navigationBarItems(trailing: Text("Score: \(viewModel.score)"))
  ```

- [x] Your UI should work in portrait or landscape on any iOS device. The cards can have any aspect ratio you‚Äôd like. This probably will not require any work on your part (that‚Äôs part of the power of SwiftUI), but be sure to continue to experiment with running on different simulators in Xcode to be sure.



### Extra Credit

- [ ] Support a gradient as the ‚Äúcolor‚Äù for a theme. Hint: fill() can take a gradient as its argument rather than a color. 
- [ ] Modify the scoring system to give more points for choosing cards more quickly. For example, maybe you get max(10 - (number of seconds since last card was chosen), 1) x (the number of points you would have otherwise earned or been penalized with). (This is just an example, be creative!). You will definitely want to familiarize yourself with the Date struct.
